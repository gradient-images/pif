# PIF

Progressive Imaging Framework

## Introduction

Welcome to the PIF project. PIF is an experimental image file format and a
processing framework built around it. PIF aims to provide a fast and capable
digital intermediate medium for film work. It's always linear, always mipmapped,
always tiled, and it's designed to be processed on the GPU.

Currently PIF is in an early experimental stage, at the moment we're evaluating
if our ideas make sense in the real world. Thank you for your interest!
